  <h2 class="art">Method</h2>

  <div id="methods">
    <ol>
      <li>Peel the onions, garlic and ginger and deseed the peppers.</li>
      <li>Put 1 onion, 1 pepper, the garlic and ginger into a food processor. Crumble in the stock cube and add the chilli (deseed it first, if you prefer a milder curry), the coriander stalks, honey and spices, then blitz to a paste.</li>
      <li> Place a large casserole pan on a medium-high heat and fry the chicken drumsticks (pull the skin off first, if you prefer) with a splash of oil for 10 minutes, or until golden, turning occasionally with tongs. Remove the chicken to a
          plate,
          leaving the pan on the heat.</li>
      <li>Roughly chop the remaining onion and pepper and add to the pan to cook for a few minutes, then tip in the paste and let it cook down for around 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Pour in 500ml of boiling water. Drain the chickpeas and add along with the tomato purée and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then stir well.</li>
      <li>Return the chicken to the pan, pop the lid on, reduce the heat and simmer gently for around 45 minutes, or until the sauce darkens and thickens.</li>
      <li>With 15 minutes to go, put 1 mug (320g) of rice and 2 mugs of boiling water into a pan with a pinch of salt and simmer with the lid on for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
      <li>Serve the curry in the middle of the table with a few dollops of yoghurt (if using) and a scattering of coriander leaves, with lemon wedges for squeezing over and the fluffy rice on the side.
