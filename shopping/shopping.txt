Description of "shopping.js" file line by line:

1-the first line adds a method "addEventListener" on the DOM object
  in the global document variable to the page, that
  tells the browser to listen to the page and first when it
  downloaded run the following function() with one parameter.

2-At the line 2 we make a variable using a variable character "const"
  called inputBox because we will use it several times, it is practical
  to have it in a
  variable, that we can call, when we need it.
  we use the method "gitElementById" to git Input element in
  the global document.
  There are many ways to declare variables for example by using
  the following keys: Var, let and const.
  Const is used for variables, that are constant in the opposite to the let,
  which can be used when we need multiply to change the value of the variables .

  The same concept for the third and fourth lines, but in these lines
  I used another method to call the elements.
  This method gives you more control on the elements and finally on your
  html file.

3-line 6 is calling the "button" element and adds an eventListener to it,
  which has tow parameters.
  the first one is a click event and the second one is a function with single
  event parameter. The function will be fired, when the user click on the button.

4-The function will create many new variables meanly it starts with the inputValue line 7,
  which we get from user then it put this value in a new created listItem at line 8
   by calling our function "createNewListItem".
  to that point we can not see any thing on our page, but we can see a list item in
  the console but it still not appended to the "ul" list.

5-To avoid empty and whitespaces from the user we put at the 9 an "if statement or condition".
  the line 9 tells the browser to append the new list item to the "ul list", that means to our
  page in case the condition is right in other case the browser will jump over this code to the
  next block or step.

6-Till here it is pretty good but we have a small issue, we want to disable the button
  after adding a new list item so we disable it at line 9 then we want an empty and focused
  input box,that happens at lines 13 & 14.

7-At the line 18 we add an eventListener to the input box, the method eventListener takes
  tow parameters, first one is the event "keyup", which happens when the user release the key,
  but we should add some conditions to this process, the first the input box must not be an empty
  string and it must not have whitespaces then the key will be enabled at line 19, second
  the pressed key must be the "Enter key" line 20.
  The function runs and creates a list item by using our CreateNewListItem including some tow conditions, one
  is the input box value and the condition the input content should be empty from whitespaces,
  then it starts to append li to the shopping list
  and finally it sets the input line to an empty string at line 23.

8-At line 27 the browser checks the condition in "if statement" if it write is and then it makes
  the button to the disabled mode because the condition is true.

9-The lines 31 and 32 runs when we reload or download the page at the beginning.
  so it turns the button to disable and focuses on the input box.

10-from the line 37 to 44 the it creates the following structure
 <li><span>itemText</span><button>Go</button></li>.

11-At line 49 we add an EventListener to the already created button element with tow
   parameters, first one is click event and the second is the function, which is
   responsible for deleting the item after clicking on the button and it declares the
   deleted item name with the the text between the single quotes in the console on line 50.
   line 51 removes the "li".
   line 52 sets the focus again to the input box.

12-Line 53 returns the li list item.
